<h5 class="name kok">KOK</h5>
<p class="song kok" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>SONG</strong><br>
And the banjo serenader, and the others of his race,<br>
And the piano-organist - I've got him on the list!<br>
And the person who can smile while writing "Kind regards,"<br>
Then sends reminders marked in red across your calling cards.
</p>

<h5 class="name poo">POO</h5>
<p class="speech poo"><strong>RECITATIVE</strong><br>
Your list appears to lengthen with remarkable speed.
</p>

<h5 class="name kok">KOK</h5>
<p class="song kok" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>SONG</strong><br>
And that pestilent photographer, forever in your way,<br>
With a "just one more" insistence till the fading end of day;<br>
And the clumsy social critic who declares all joy a crime,<br>
Why, none of them would suffer if removed before their time!
</p>

<h5 class="name poo">POO</h5>
<p class="speech poo"><strong>RECITATIVE</strong><br>
I see. A practical list, then, and carefully curated.
