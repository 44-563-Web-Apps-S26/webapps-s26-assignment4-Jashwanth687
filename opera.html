    <h1>Jashwanth Reddy Baddam Light Opera</h1>
    <h2>The Gondoliers</h2>
<h3><em>The Mikado</em></h3>
<h4>Act I — Scene: A Courtyard in Ko-Ko’s Official Residence</h4>

<p><em>(Ko-Ko is discovered seated on a garden bench, with a list in his hand. Pooh-Bah stands by him.)</em></p>

<p><strong>KO-KO.</strong><br>
As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,
I’ve got a little list— I’ve got a little list
Of society offenders who might well be underground,
And who never would be missed— who never would be missed!</p>

<p><strong>POOH-BAH.</strong><br>
Indeed? That’s very interesting.</p>

<p><strong>KO-KO.</strong><br>
There’s the idiot who praises, with enthusiastic tone,
All centuries but this, and every country but his own;
And the lady from the provinces, who dresses like a guy,
And who “doesn’t think she dances, but would rather like to try”;
And that singular anomaly, the lady novelist—
I don’t think she’d be missed— I’m sure she’d not be missed!</p>

<p><strong>POOH-BAH.</strong><br>
You are certainly rendering the State some service.</p>

<p><strong>KO-KO.</strong><br>
And that Nisi Prius nuisance, who just now is rather rife,
The Judicial humorist— I’ve got him on the list!
And the idiot who thinks it is a clever thing to do
To look like other people’s wives and say “At home to you”;
And the advertising quack who wearies with his grin,
And the music-hall singer with a caricatured chin—
They’d none of ’em be missed— they’d none of ’em be missed!</p>

<p><strong>POOH-BAH.</strong><br>
And I suppose you propose to select one of these?</p>

<p><strong>KO-KO.</strong><br>
I am much indebted to you for your suggestion. I shall put it in hand at once.</p>
