<p class="song kok" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>SONG</strong><br>
As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,<br>
I've got a little list - I've got a little list<br>
Of society offenders who might well be underground,<br>
And who never would be missed - who never would be missed!
</p>

<h5 class="name poo">POO</h5>
<p class="speech poo"><strong>RECITATIVE</strong><br>
Indeed? That's very interesting.

<h5 class="name kok">KOK</h5>
<p class="song kok" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>SONG</strong><br>
There's the idiot who praises, with enthusiastic tone,<br>
All centuries but this, and every country but his own;<br>
And the lady from the provinces, who dresses like a guy,<br>
And who "doesn't think she dances, but would rather like to try";<br>
And that singular anomaly, the lady novelist -<br>
I don't think she'd be missed - I'm sure she'd not be missed!
</p>

<p class="speech poo"><strong>RECITATIVE</strong><br>
You are certainly rendering the State some service.
</p>

<h5 class="name kok">KOK</h5>
<p class="song kok" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>SONG</strong><br>
And that Nisi Prius nuisance, who just now is rather rife,<br>
The Judicial humorist - I've got him on the list!<br>
And the idiot who thinks it is a clever thing to do<br>
To look like other people's wives and say "At home to you";<br>
And the advertising quack who wearies with his grin,<br>
And the music-hall singer with a caricatured chin -<br>
They'd none of 'em be missed - they'd none of 'em be missed!
</p>

<h5 class="name poo">POO</h5>
<p class="speech poo"><strong>RECITATIVE</strong><br>
And I suppose you propose to select one of these?

I am much indebted to you for your suggestion. I shall put it in hand at once.
